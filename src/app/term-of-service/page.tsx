            These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your use of the

            <strong>Brothers International</strong> (&quot;Company&quot;,
            &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;us&quot;). By accessing or
            using our website, mobile applications, shipping services, or any
            other service provided by Brothers International (collectively, the
            &quot;Services&quot;), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you

          <h4>1. Using our Services</h4>
          <p>
            You may use our Services only if you are at least 18 years old and
            capable of forming a binding contract. You agree to provide
            accurate, current, and complete information when creating an account
            or booking a shipment, and to maintain and promptly update your

          <h4>2. Bookings, Pickup and Delivery</h4>
          <p>
            All pickup and delivery dates and times provided by Brothers
            International are estimates unless explicitly stated otherwise. We
            will make commercially reasonable efforts to meet pickup and
            delivery estimates, but delays may occur due to weather, customs,
            carrier performance, public holidays, or other events beyond our
            control.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is your responsibility to provide correct pickup and delivery
            addresses and to ensure that recipients accept deliveries. If a
            package is returned to us due to incorrect or incomplete address
            information provided by you, you will be charged for return shipping
            and any applicable storage fees.

          <p>
            Rates for Services are provided at the time of the booking and are
            subject to change. All payments are due in the currency shown on the
            invoice. You are responsible for any taxes, duties, customs fees, or
            other charges related to the shipment unless otherwise agreed in
            writing.

          <p>
            You may not ship items that are illegal, hazardous, restricted by
            applicable law, or prohibited by our carrier partners. Examples of
            prohibited items include but are not limited to explosives,
            flammable liquids, illegal drugs, certain chemicals, and other
            dangerous goods. If you are unsure whether an item is prohibited,
            contact us before booking the shipment.

          <h4>5. Packaging and Labeling</h4>
          <p>
            You are responsible for packaging, labeling, and preparing shipments
            in a manner adequate to protect contents during transit. Shipments
            that require special handling must be clearly marked and declared at
            the time of booking. We are not liable for loss or damage resulting
            from inadequate packaging.

          <h4>6. Liability and Insurance</h4>
          <p>
            Except to the extent required by applicable law, Brothers
            International’s liability for loss, damage, or delay of shipments is
            limited to the lesser of (a) the declared value shown on the waybill
            and accepted by us, or (b) the maximum amount allowed under
            applicable carrier rules. We recommend that you purchase additional
            declared value or third‑party insurance when shipping high‑value
            items.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not responsible for consequential, incidental, or special
            damages, including lost business or profit, even if we were advised
            of the possibility of such damages.

            International in writing within the time period required by the
            carrier and applicable law. If you fail to file a claim within the
            required time frame, your right to recover may be lost or reduced.
